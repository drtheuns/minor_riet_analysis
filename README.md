# Minor RIET Analysis

This was a tool created for the Minor Research in Emerging Technologies. The goal was to create a tool
to interpret and analyze the data generated by the [prototype](https://github.com/drtheuns/minor_riet).

The tool creates several charts for use in the [paper](https://github.com/drtheuns/minor_riet_paper).
This repository exists mostly because it is referenced in the paper itself (under section 6.1 "Test results").

# Contents

- `main.db` holds the data from the prototype. See `models.py` for a mapping of the tables/fields.
- `analyze.py` is the main file, and this parses the data into usable charts for the paper.
