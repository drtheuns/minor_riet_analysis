# Minor RIET Analysis

This was a tool created for the Minor Research in Emerging Technologies. The goal was to create a tool
to interpret and analyze the data generated by the [prototype](https://github.com/drtheuns/minor_riet).

The tool creates several charts for use in the paper. This repository exists mostly because it is referenced
in the paper itself (under section 6.1 "Test results").
